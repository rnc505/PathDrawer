PathDrawer
==========

The first application in a series of applications to create a Walking Paths program for Vanderbilt University's campus.

This specific program will be used to create various "choice points" as "forks" in the various paths across campus and the paths between these choice points.  The data collected and generated from this program will be used to create the final "Vanderbilt University Walking Map" program.
